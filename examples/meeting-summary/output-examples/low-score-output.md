# Meeting Notes

The team met to discuss the Q1 roadmap. They talked about the dashboard, API v2, and mobile notifications.

The dashboard is being worked on and there are some performance issues. They're thinking about adding caching.

For the API, they need to figure out the deprecation timeline. Some customers want more time.

Mobile notifications will have settings for users to control them.

There are some concerns about resources for QA.

The next meeting is in two weeks.
